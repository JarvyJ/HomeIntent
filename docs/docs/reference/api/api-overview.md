# API Overview
This is a quick reference for anyone who wants to build their own Home Intent components. There are two main classes developers will utilize while building a component - the `Intents` class and a `HomeIntent` object. Home Intent is designed to work as a class based system. We strongly recommend taking a look at the [Example Component](../developer/example-component.md) to get a feel for how it works. This is just a reference for all the methods that are available when importing from `home_intent`.

Home Intent's speech abilities are built on top of Rhasspy. It is highly recommended to read the page on [training sentences](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training/), as Home Intent builds upon them.
