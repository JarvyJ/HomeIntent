# Home Intent

![Home Intent Logo](/.github/home-intent-logo.png)

Home Intent is an open source locally hosted intent handler. Using [Rhasspy](https://rhasspy.readthedocs.io) and integrating with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) it functions as an easy-to-use voice assistant for your home.

Documentation is at [https://homeintent.io](https://homeintent.io).

## Ideology
Home Intent wants to avoid the problem of asking for a light to turn on and only one bulb in a fixture turns on because the fuzzy match picked the wrong thing. By integrating directly between Home Assistant and Rhasspy with easy customizations, Home Intent has better control over the entity and voice systems so voice interactions work more reliably.


## Integrations
We're currently working hard on getting well integrated with Home Assistant. You can see what's been integrated on the [Home Assistant Integration](https://homeintent.io/integrations/home-assistant/) page in the example sentences!
